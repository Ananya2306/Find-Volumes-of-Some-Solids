# Find Volume Of Cuboid , Cylinder or Cone .......
<b>
Question - 4 
<br>
The Volumes of Solids Like Cuboid , Cylinder and Cone ....<br>
can be Calculated by the formula :
<br>
1. Volume of Cuboid = (v = l*b*h);
2. Volume of Cylinder = (v = (22/7.0)*r*r*h);
3. Volume of Cone = (v = (1/3)*(22/7.0)*r*r*h);

Using a <i> Switch Case Statement </i> <br>
Write a Program to find the different solids by taking sutable variable and data types(double , int , float , char , etc)..................
